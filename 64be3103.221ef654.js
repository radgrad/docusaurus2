STAR does a decent job of listing the classes you need to take in order to graduate, but seeing all the different ICS courses for each of the different specialty tracks would be beneficial. I think it would also be a cool idea to offer an exploration of the pros and cons, possible jobs, and actual skillsets of each of the different tracks (ex: common tech stacks for data science careers versus security careers).  I have spent way too long looking at the ICS graduation requirement forms to plan every single credit possible and optimizing my semesters so I got to explore some of the data science track without having to commit myself to that track as a means of figuring out what specifically I want to do within the domain of ICS. However, that took an exceptional amount  of time to do, and it would be a great idea to have some way of communicating these experiences with new students. This might be in a similar style to a blog post, or a list of personal anecdotes and recommendations for navigating the ICS degree? (The best example I can think of is taking MATH 301/307/372 instead of ICS 141/142 to allow me to do either the data analysis track or the general track, and taking electives like ICS 435 Machine Learning early on to get a feel if I want to switch to the data science track before it was too late to make the change) Finally, I think having a section on non-ICS classes would be a good idea. Students could recommend electives that they took that fills multiple different graduation requirements, suggest what type of classes they were able to manage in one semester (ex: not taking three other intense classes when taking ICS 311), or even explore non-ICS classes that they could get an override to count towards their degree (ex: one of my favorite classes I\'ve taken was EE 491F - Software Reverse Engineering, and I was able to use it as an ICS 400+ elective.
