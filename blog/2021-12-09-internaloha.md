During the Fall of 2021, three undergraduates (Caliana Fortin, Jatin Pandya, and Shinya Saito) helped design and implement a new major release of the InternAloha System as part of capstone courses.

Here is the poster they created to summarize their experience:

Each student also wrote a technical report on their summer research:

 * [Pulling The Trigger With Internaloha: The New Opportunities For Internship, Shinya Saito](https://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/2021/21-02/21-02.pdf).
 * [InternAloha: Revamping Scrapers, Jatin Pandya](https://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/2021/21-03/21-03.pdf).
 * [Scraping for Students' futures: An Indepth look at the InternAloha Revamping Process, Caliana Fortin](https://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/2021/21-04/21-04.pdf).

Finally, they created a short video to describe their work:
