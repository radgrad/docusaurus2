We are delighted to welcome Andre Ruiz, Shinya Saito, Caliana Fortin, Trey Sumida, and Timothy Huo into our National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates program for Summer, 2021. They will be developing their software engineering and research skills throughout the summer by readying the RadGrad2 code base for deployment to two departments in Fall 2021, and by performing pilot studies to assess the usability of the system by students, faculty, and advisors.
