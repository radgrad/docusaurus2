title: "Summer 2021 NSF REU Results"
---

During the Summer of 2021, the RadGrad Project hosted 5 undergraduates from the University of Hawaii: Andre Ruiz, Shinya Saito, Caliana Fortin, Timothy Huo, and Trey Sumida.  Four of these students were funded by the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates program.

This team never met face-to-face, and in fact not all of them lived in Hawaii during the summer. However, we did meet twice weekly for virtual "stand up meetings" through Discord.

While we all wish we could have spent time together face-to-face, the experience was nevertheless an unqualified success. All of the students were able to get a taste of the research process and hone their software development skills.

On July 31, 2021, all of the students presented the results of their summer work during a poster session at the [University of Hawaii SURE Symposium](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/undergrad/urop/summer-undergraduate-research-experience-sure/sure-symposium-3/).

Here is the poster they presented:

They also wrote a technical report on their summer research, which is available at: [https://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/2021/21-01/21-01.pdf](https://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/2021/21-01/21-01.pdf).
