Not that it is extremely cluttered, it\u2019s clean for a first look but there are ways to make it not look so complicated to look at. Having lots of things to click on is not exactly user-friendly, so I think the website could use better organization. The RadGrad website is not too complicated to navigate though, I find it easy to navigate and easy to find the information I want to know about a particular field. There\u2019s a ton of information so I do think it will help not only me but many others in having a better degree experience. It\u2019s definitely a beginner-friendly way to provide what computer science has to offer and the potential it has compared to other fields of study."),Object(n.b)("h2",{id:"211-s22-40"},"211-S22-40"),Object(n.b)("p",null,"Since using RadGrad, I learned, experienced, and realized many things. Among some are what clubs/organizations are available, courses, majors/jobs, and branches. I really enjoyed the layout and how easy it was to navigate. It also, as a freshman, really opened my eyes to how much computer science related things there are. Some of my favorite parts of RadGrad is how it describes almost every little thing where it is easily understandable, but mostly, how it takes me interests and applies them to things that I might also have interest in, helping on guiding me toward a specific area."),Object(n.b)("p",null,"Something I learned about computer science that I didn\u2019t know before would be how many fields there are computer science related. For example, before, I thought there was only Cyber Security, Software Engineering, and Computer Engineering. Now I know that there is Data Science, Network Engineer, AI/Machine Learning Engineer, and so much more. I even know how Data Science takes large sets of complex information and processes it to make it understandable to other people. Or how a Network Engineer basically maintain all networks like wired, wireless, or cloud-connected."),Object(n.b)("p",null,"I did discover new interests. Starting, I was only mainly interested in coding, now I am interested in Algorithms, Application Development, Computer Graphics, and more. All I knew was block coding from code.org, now I know eclipse and though I get the same feeling of accomplishment, I can now add that as goals to accomplish learning Algorithms, Application Development, and more. I also have a better picture in my head of the course I want to take, when I want to do what, and what each thing is to better help my decision-making process.  Overall, I do think RadGrad is an amazing idea to help navigate students like me, and especially freshmen, to the right direction and best chance of having a successful career/degree path. I feel like there should be something like this for every major or degree. I think this because it is an interactive, personal, and informative way to decide/guide our path, future, and plan. I feel like if there was anything to add at all, it would be an area where\nit recommends. For example, if I am interested in Cyber Security, it should recommend attending the zoom call that was with a representative of the FBI, which then would recommend doing an internship with a cyber security related field, which then could overall set me up for a perfect year. Even providing templates so you can see the average and general plan of doing that major so if you wanted to switch, you could see what other major has similar requirements.
