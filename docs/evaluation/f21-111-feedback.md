## Overview

This page contains feedback from approximately 55 students who completed the New Student Tutorial in ICS 111, Fall 2021. There were 204 students in ICS 111, so this represents a response rate of 27%.   

All responses are at least generally positive about RadGrad, and some are extremely positive.  The responses provide evidence that RadGrad can achieve several important goals:

* Improve student awareness of the breadth of topics that can be pursued through computer science;
* Improve student awareness of community groups and other organizations related to their interests;
* Provide a mechanism for them to plan out their undergraduate degree experience to integrate coursework and extracurricular activities in a synergistic manner;
* The user interface and overall user experience (including the New Student Tutorial) were effective.

Criticisms and suggestions for improvement in the system are highlighted in *italics*.  The most common issues raised were:

* Since both RadGrad and STAR involve degree planning, better integration between the two would be helpful. For example, some students wished that RadGrad could indicate/enforce prerequisites, required courses, and other degree plan components.
* Some students reacted negatively to the amount of planning required to figure out an entire four year program and "complete" the Degree Plan with 100 points in all three myICE categories.
* Students who are not planning to do a CS degree found the experience less relevant, although they still found the experience to be useful. (And several commented that they wished they had something similar for their major.)

## Student Comments

(1) This was my first experience with RadGrad, so I had no idea what to expect. But, I was surprised by the sheer amount of information that I was able to find. The Personal To-Do list was helpful in helping me determine the tasks at hand. And each of the individual tasks themselves did not feel like they didn't have a purpose.

Being able to see all the possible ICS courses I could take was also particularly helpful. Prior to this, I would look through STAR for possible courses and course descriptions. But, RadGrad's format made the information accessible and easy to understand. I will definitely be referencing RadGrad in the future when I apply for Spring 2022 classes.

The opportunities tasks were also quite interesting. I did not realize the number of opportunities that UH Manoa offered for women and minorities. I am particularly interested in the Society of Women Engineers at UH Manoa. This is my first year at UH Manoa and I haven't had many opportunities to meet like-minded individuals with similar interests. I am also very excited at the prospect of coding competitions!

---

(2) I was surprised how easy RadGrad was to use.  The design of it was very pleasing to the eye and easy to navigate.  I also believe trying to rack up ICE points makes the experience a lot more enjoyable.   Unlike other websites, I had an easy time understanding what each function did.

I very much enjoyed looking through and adding classes and opportunities to my list.  It truly opened up my eyes to the many things open for me to further my college experience.  Overall, I believe RadGrad is a very useful tool for college students.  It is something I will continue to use throughout my college career.

---

(3) My experience with RadGrad is that at first I would think it wouldn't help me at all but when I went to do the tutorial and it was very informative which made me changed my mind and realize that RadGrad could be helpful. The tutorial was very well explained and comprehensible that I understood what it said the first time I read it.

---

(4) At first when I was putting together my courses, I thought it was sort of cheesy getting the 100 points in each of the three categories. However, as I actually started looking through each of the courses and opportunities, I started to get really interested in some of them. I don't think I would have found some of those hackathons and programs easily without RadGrad so I am glad I found them pretty earlier in my undergrad experience.

RadGrad seems to be a really nice resource to have as an undergraduate. You have really easy access to a list of opportunities courses. Another thing that I really like about it is the descriptions and instructions to help you apply to it. I can absolutely see myself using throughout my undergraduate experience.

---

(5) RadGrad is an interesting tool. I'm glad we get a great resource for free. I think as I progress in school it will really come in handy for networking and building my resume. I also like being able to see all of the courses that come with computer science, so I can plan where I want to take my degree a little better.

*But as I'm just starting my degree, it's a little overwhelming at first. Planning out my entire degree in this moment when I haven't taken much classes seems a little extra. Because who knows where I'll be taking my degree as I delve more into the topic of computer science. But this is a small downside.* I think the opportunities that RadGrad will offer me in the future will be super great.

---

(6) My experience with RadGrad was surprisingly quite positive overall. I really enjoyed the snappy and stateful structure of the app, and the layout was pleasing and simple enough for easy navigation. I could update my interests or career goals, and it was immediately updated across the app. Overall, the user experience didn't have any kinks. As far as content, I found it extremely useful to see which career goals fit my selected interests, and I found it exciting to see possible CS opportunities for me moving forward. The ability to "level up" is personally enticing, as well.

*For UI improvements, I would get rid of the '...' after 'Explore' in the nav-bar. With a dropdown, the ellipsis is redundant. For UX improvements, I would do a couple things. First, I would explicitly and obviously denote the amount of ICE points each opportunity or course is worth. Feels like a necessary proponent to the function of the site. Second, I would rethink the approach to laying out courses and opportunities within the Planner. Specifically, I think it's important to communicate to the student user the delineation between the purposes of course planning within RadGrad and within STAR. Also, I felt like there wasn't enough info given to me to plan out an ideal date for each course or opportunity. Using RadGrad, I want to feel so well equipped and informed about every decision moving forward.*

---

(7) I think that RadGrad is a great tool for most undergraduate students that aren’t sure where their degree is going to take them after their education. It helps students manage their track when they’re completing their computer science degree, and I could see this as a potential tool for employers to check out the students credentials. Some of the features I would like to utilize in my time are the 'opportunities' because it seems like I could get some great experiences from the outside world of programming. Overall, RadGrad is a pretty cool tool and students who are on the fence about it should get their toes wet and test it out. They might even be more surprised about how great of a tool it could be.

---

(8) I believe that RadGrad is a great tool to help college students like myself plan out their college experience. It has many career options you can choose from and lists out the courses related to that specific career, which was very helpful to me. *At first, however, it was very complicated to get through the degree planner section.* I lined up my schedule on RadGrad that meets the graduation requirements on my STAR GPS but it said it was not completed. Once I got over that hurdle it was smooth sailing from there.

I also enjoyed looking through the many opportunities I can participate in while going to college. Opportunities such as ITMA, CCDC, and National Cyber League all interested me and RadGrad gave me the base to be able to participate in those activities.

---

(9) I think the idea of creating RadGrad was really good. It helps us (students) to understand what types of career related to our degree we can have, what knowledge we need to get for this and create a clear plan of what we need to do. What I also like about RadGrad is that we can find like-minded people to work on creation of projects together.

---

(10) *The first time I encountered RadGrad, I felt very overwhelmed.* There are a lot of tasks under the High Priority tab. I need to check my program sheet to be able to do the degree plan and its corresponding courses. There were a lot of options for interests and career goals which I find very helpful to a novice in the field of computer science.

Overall, I find RadGrad a helpful tool for any Computer Science major student as it prepares them in their chosen career path. It helps them to make connections through different organizations related to the field as well as different opportunities that are available while they are in the program.

---

(11) I need more time to fully go through it, but I do like RadGrad.  *I will start with my gripes first.  When adding things to my profile, I would like to have a button or option to just straight up add the interest instead of having to click "See Details/Add to Profile" > click "Add to Profile" > wait for the green checkmark animation to finish > go back to the courses/opportunities/whatever.  There are some classes that are either required or I know I want to take, so removing all these extra steps will greatly improve the user experience.  When I was adding opportunities to my profile, there was nothing telling me what I needed to do to remove it from being high priority besides reading through the user manual or checking the square in the top right.  Adding something that tells the user "you need more x points, click here for suggestions" will help.  All the other steps were clearly defined and told me what to do to remove it from high priority.  The one oddball was adding opportunities to my profile.  Adding when opportunities and classes are available (is it Fall only?  Spring?  Both?  Offered in Summer?) is also something that will be very helpful.*

Outside of that, I love everything about this.  Seeing detailed descriptions of courses and opportunities, setting your interests, COURSE REVIEWS (SUPER COOL LOVE THIS), and a planner that is 50000000x better than STAR is super awesome.  I have to spend more time with this, but I really like this.  If it can be expanded to include all departments, that would be insanely cool.  Having everything in one site that is easily searchable...amazing.


---

(12) I was first impressed with RADGRAD's design and the layout was well done. One of the most important things about a website is the layout, design, and interface of the entirety of it. I felt like it was easy to use, but the tabs were a little much. The color scheme was very good and it was professionally done much like a website with important information on it.

Based on what I've learned with HTML, a responsive website is difficult to achieve and I do think the creators of this website did a good job, but with the navigation bar, *I think it would look more seamless if it converted into a bar that had three lines on it and you clicked to view each tab.* This has been an eye-opening experience and I definitely did enjoy looking through all the various activities and opportunities available. This is a great resource for ICS students.

---

(13) After completing the RadGrad new user tutorial, I have found that this website has a lot of useful tools to help the user plan for the future. Though, if someone does not know what to do in the future, then they would have a harder time completing the tutorial. As someone who does not really know what to do, completing this tutorial was a challenge, especially since I was planning my future classes, extracurricular, and even career paths.

Even though planning my career/degree path was a challenge, I was learning about all these different occupations and activities found at not only UH Manoa, but outside the university and I thought that was super cool. My favorite part of the whole RadGrad experience was looking into what my interests are because I discovered a bunch of different skills/interests that I did not even know existed! Overall, I definitely enjoyed using RadGrad and plan on going back to it once I am more confident on what I want to do in the future.

---

(14) After getting to play around with it, I thought the concept of Radgrad was very interesting. Although I am not particularly interested in computer science classes, the website was very helpful and overall easy to use. The point system they created motivated me to look through the wide variety of classes and opportunities, and the layout made it easy for me to see which ones fit my interests better. The ICE tab in the website was especially helpful as it pointed out specific courses and opportunities I needed to up my score.

I had no problems with the website, other than not being very interested in computer science. If Radgrad were tailored to a variety of majors and professions, I feel it could be extremely useful. I had trouble finding my "interests" in the beginning, as they were very specific to computers, which I have a hard time finding interest in. The website did open my eyes to the seemingly endless amount of courses and opportunities provided at Manoa, and I'm glad I was able to try it out.

---

(15) I think RadGrad is great because it give me opportunities and a path to finish my degree. I would like to join organizations but I still need to learn more about Computer Science/ coding.

---

(16) RadGrad appears to offer lots of info on various topics related to computer science. I appreciate how it recommends courses, opportunities, and experiences based on stated goals and interests, as well as the ability to plan out a degree path in advance. The potential for networking within the profession also seems very important.

*The only issue I have with it is that it does not seem to differentiate at all between ICS majors and other students.* Since I am only planning on completing a minor, I am unable to complete the myICE section unless I were to add courses, opportunities, and experiences that I have no intention of actually completing just for the sake of filling up the circles. I would greatly appreciate the ability to identify myself as a non-major so that RadGrad would accurately reflect the reality of my situation.

---

(17) After using the tutorial I felt RadGrad helps me a lot, during the RadGrad interested and career goals tab, the interested tab helps me defined what knowledge do I interested, I can add those interested into my file so I can use them in career goals to see what kinds of career was fit my interested, the career goals provide me the information what are the job you could get and even provide the course choice for you if you are interested, you can see is your interested is need in the career or not, which helps me a lot for right now, at least I have an simple map of what should I do and go right now, even there are still something unsure.  The course and opportunities tab are also gives me the great help, the course tells the the basic concept of what are those classes are and there is also some review comment provide from the student who's taking this classes before, provide some basic information, and opportunities are also pretty useful, it provide me some resource of find job, join other group with same interest, looking for the information I needed, those gives me an goal and where I should keep up on.

---

(18) I think RadGrad is a good help platform for ICS students. RadGrad's goal is to improve the undergraduate degree experience. RadGrad should provide consultants with better ways to help students plan STEM degree programs. This means not only helping students determine which courses to take, but also helping them to better assess how STEM undergraduate courses fit their future career and personal goals. RadGrad should help guide students to an appropriate undergraduate degree experience based on their specific interests and career goals. RadGrad has a lot of content and many tasks. As long as students complete it, it will be of great help.

---

(19) My RadGrad experience was a very eventful one that acted as a good eye opener for me. The planning portion was very helpful in terms of what classes are available at UH, as well as spacing out my classes. Prior to RadGrad, I had only thought of taking ICS 111 and 211 and did not know much about what courses to take after. However, the course listing allowed me to view what classes were available to take and now I know that I will be leaning towards the software engineering side of ICS. I also know the rough times/semesters I will aim to take these higher level ICS courses.

Apart of the academic courses that are open to me, there were also options of planning out extra-curriculars such as clubs, jobs, and events that are available to me on my journey into the real world of working ICS. I plan on joining the ACM club, doing internships, and try to get a job that will allow me to gain experience of working computer science during my time as a college student. There are also lots of learning workshops that caught my interest through RadGrad; Cloud Honolulu, Google Summer of Code, and Career Fair were the ones to stick out to me. I also plan on doing internships throughout my College career before graduating and gaining the working experience before graduating. I plan on using RadGrad regularly throughout my pursuit into the Software Engineer field.

---

(20) My experience with RadGrad was pretty good. While I got confused on two tasks (opportunity and classes), It allowed me to get exposure on the different types of work and extracurricular activities associated with computer science. I was actually able to find some things I was interested in, and I thought that it was cool that they suggested some careers and extra-curriculars based on your interests and career goals. It also had detailed explanations of each item in the website which helped me figure out what I was interested in, as I have not heard of half the things on the website. The different opportunities on the website were also very nice to have. As a freshman this year, we didn't have as much opportunities to find out about the opportunities on campus, but through this, I found some cool clubs I was intrigued with.

*When I first got on RadGrad, I was a bit confused because I didn't know where to log in, as well as how to use the website.* I feel that the video on radgrad, as well as the walkthrough helped me figure out the gist of how to navigate the website and use it to my advantage. *A con I found was that I didn't plan on taking so much classes (maybe one or two more after this class) in ICS but it made me add a bunch of classes to complete the task even though I was hesitant on adding so many courses.* I feel that if I was a computer science major, I would benefit from this website a lot. Even though I may not be one, I will most likely use this website in the future to find some opportunities I am interested in.

---

(21) About RadGrad, the new student walkthrough was smooth and user friendly. *The only problem I had was that I needed to clear the high-priority things. I had to add a lot of things I didn't exactly thought about before in order to clear the high-priority checklist.*

Any feedback I would recommend in improving RadGrad would be not requiring to finish the degree plan because things may not always go the way it should be. But other than that, Radgrad is a good resource to use when thinking about future plans. Very good for planning.

---

(22) With my experience with RadGrad I have learned that it is a very useful website/tool for setting up your career plan and the opportunities you have. Radgrad helps you organize your interests to connect with other important people. The website lets you choose your career goals. In Radgrad you control what aspects of your interests are visible to other members. It will help you create a balanced undergraduate good experience involving innovation, competency, and experience.

In RadGrad you can view popular careers, interests, and opportunities. This tool could help you get a good job after graduation. After graduation it may be difficult to show employers your experience. With Radgrad all your information is organized on their website! Even if you don't think you need RadGrad, computer science is a very important skill to have.

---

(23) I really liked the class portion of it; matching your interests and career goals to help you pick the right upper level courses for yourself was, I felt, very helpful. I personally know the relative career path I want to take, but it helped elucidate some precise specializations I could look at in that field.

I also really enjoyed the opportunities section, because I always wonder how people get a hold of the interviews or know where to go to sign up for these things, or even know how they are going on.

*However, the opportunities section was outrageous to complete.* I definitely think it would benefit from being scaled back (ie: not needing to be filled up with 20+ extra curriculars). I do feel like I put some time and effort into selecting 5 that seemed like they fit my interest profile, and then I just kind of had to keep jamming  useless stuff in there to fill up the quota.

---

(24) I am completely new when it comes to getting a degree in computer science and have been out of school for 7 years. I have my finance degree so this is all new to me. Using rad grad actually helped me get a lot more information about my degree and what I can do with it along with all the extra curriculars. I never had anything like this 7 years ago which would have been very useful since it is a one stop shop for everything. I liked it and it was very useful.

---

(25) The RadGrad was an amazing experience if I was to give it a rating it would get a 7/10. It was able to show off a bunch of different courses for ics. Not only that it also showed a bunch of events for computer programming or groups in the school. It was easy to navigate for what section you were looking for. But every website has its issues and that for me was the planner it kind of just let you put courses in random spots. Also, the ICE bars were kind of weird too to the put I was just adding random courses to get all three bars up.

Let’s focus on the good first which is the amount, of course, it showed off and how you could favorite certain interstate so you could look for courses that would be most helpful for you in the future. Next was the huge amount of events or groups that the site showed that you could have participated in. I love how it allowed searching for the course and events you wanted so easy you could sort it by course number, recommend, or ABC order. *But the bad stuff for the site is the planner it should show what course needs to be done first in order to take the one you want first and not just let you go crazy in the planner.* For example, I can have a 613 course in spring before even taking the other course makes organizing confusing. *The second bad thing is that the tutorial wants all three ICE bars to be filled but doing that can be annoying.* Sure you can have it so you can only see courses that give a certain point for a bar but when the points can only be 5 and still be able to show up even with the filter on is weird and annoying. In all, I found the RadGrad site enjoyable to search on which is why I would give it a 7/10.

---

(26) Radgrad is a very useful application and I can see how effective it is firsthand. My experience with it was good as it had given me instructions (in detail) on how to achieve my high-priority tasks. It is very engaging and has its creative, unique perks too. It was able to show me the different careers and opportunities that I can avail of if I continue my journey as a computer science major.

Being an undergraduate student with little to no experience in computer science, this software can access and allow me the resources to take when I need assistance or if I want to foresee what my classes would end up looking like in the future. What I like about this application is that it provides feedback from other students. Feedback is always a good read when considering what classes to take/ the tips and advice that we can further apply to that class. RadGrad is definitely an organized helpful resource. 

---

(27) *RadGrad was a bit frustrating for me to use, since I only wanted to save a small certain amount of courses and experiences.* However, it helped me discover all the opportunities that can make me a better student as a computer science major.

Though internships were not available as of now, I am interested in looking into what type of internships there are where I can get real life experience coding. I believe this section will come in handy for me since hands-on experiences are the best way for me to develop a clear understanding.

Throughout the competency section, I was able to look at reviews of students who have taken the courses in the past and a brief description of what the classes were about. Since STAR does not have much information on the courses, this helped me imagine and plan out my future courses. 

---

(28) My experience with RadGrad has been very positive overall. I really like the idea of having a tool to help chart and plan career building skills. The conception and execution seems to go over well. *The general concept is good; however, some small quality of life improvements could be introduced such as STAR integration so we don't have to manually enter in all the classes that we are slated to take already.* RadGrad seems to touch on this a bit, but perhaps having a section for research and the associated professors involved so that students could maybe reach out. Beyond those two recommendations the overall tool is really helpful.

The UI/UX stuff seems to be handled well and was pretty straight forward to understand. I did not seem to struggle all that much with setting up and configuring my account. I liked the course catalog and being able to see all the different courses that are available and what they teach. 

---

(29) RadGrad is a very great tool to map out my time here in college with focus on preparing me for the future. The details of what topics each class has compared to the extra curricular activities got me thinking of where I want to be after college. Looking at all the different things that can be done outside of class and internships is very exciting and I can't wait to jump into different projects.

I really appreciate the support UHM's Computer Science department has for the students. I feel absolutely welcomed to indulge myself into learning all I can about computer science and utilizing the resources around me to apply what I learn to real world experience.

---

(30) RadGrad is definitely a good website to use to explore the different options within the ICS major. *But it was a little overwhelming to add-in 17 classes into a three / four-year plan as someone who isn’t an ICS major.*

---

(31) After finally having the chance to set up my RadGrad account I think the whole tutorial process was amazing. The tutorial was easy to follow and the goals per page were very helpful because it made sure that you are following along and not just flipping through the tutorials. As a first impression, the website was neat and easy to navigate.

I like how the website sectioned that to-do list because one step leads to another and it made it very organized. I also like the degree planner because I got to read the descriptions of the different ICS classes that I can take. It also organizes the classes and opportunities by semester which I think is very helpful because it helps me visualize the classes I should be taking and the time I have. I think the opportunities tab was the most interesting because some of those listed events I didn’t know are offered here in Hawaii. I think the whole experience so far was very interesting and I’m hoping to use this as a guide in college. 

---

(32) *It was a little difficult getting the hang of RadGrad,* but I'm glad the tutorial was very thorough. I liked how the tutorial also had screenshots and a goal at the bottom of each page to ensure we did what we were supposed to. I thought it was pretty cool how there's a list of all the courses.

I definitely did not realize how many opportunities there were at UH Manoa! It's also pretty cool how RadGrad can help us network and even land a job after college. That's one of my main fears, even as a freshman. I've heard so many stories where people don't land their first job until years later, so I am glad RadGrad can help with that too.

---

(33) RadGrad has helped me to see all the different types of courses I can choose from. I found many courses that I'm interested in and I'm thinking of taking these opportunities because they are all good opportunities to choose from. I'm looking into more of ios because I like resolving apple technology issues. I'm mainly a tech person to my family.

As a tech person to my family, I mainly do all the troubleshooting with any technical issues for my family. I've seen many great opportunities here in Hawaii that I can do as well, but I'm not too sure yet because I'm still learning how to code. I would join some of the opportunities that I chose, but I'll get the basics of programming first then I'll go on from there.

---

(34) I have no previous experience with RadGrad so I'm still kind of new to this. After reading the user tutorial and "why you should use RadGrad" section I do think that this will be a very good opportunity for me to learn more about computer science with others.

---

(35) I think RadGrad is great because it give me opportunities and a path to finish my degree. I would like to join organizations but I still need to learn more about Computer Science/ coding.

---

(36) *RadGrad provided a lot of job variety but the setup is rather forcing.* Some of us are not completely sure if we would like to go into ICS in the future. I do like the variety of opportunities it gives us. I was able to complete the tasks but I am unsure how to satisfy the conditions for the degree planner.

---

(37) Starting off, RadGrad was intimidating. I felt like it wouldn't been overwhelming and stressful thinking about the future and how I have so much I have to do. However, I came to be the opposite. Instead, it made me feel comfortable and intrigued with all the opportunities, courses, paths, etc. I found myself wanting to do a lot of things right now. Though, this semester it may be hard for me to participate in any ics related things (since I am new and not good yet), I feel prepared for my second semester and years after that. RadGrad really helped me build an idea of what I want to do and what I should do based off my interests.

*Navigating the sight was a little confusing at first because I didn't know what was happening* (like how the planner included all opportunities, scholarships, and courses. ( I thought it only included the courses). I wish I could see the internship opportunities because one thing I learned from my siblings is that interning is very important. It is a great way to gain experience so you can get a permanent job after graduation. Overall, RadGrad was scary to think about at first, but it really helped me set my eyes straight at the end. I at least have an idea of the path I could possibly be going on.

---

(38) Radgrad gives me an opportunity of finding different levels and types of computer experience that I never thought would be so easy to find.   Growing up wanting to work in the field of computers, I have always heard that you have a better opportunity to get a job with the amount of extra experience you have had as opposed to just graduating and taking courses.  It makes you more diverse in your skillset and you are more prepared for the problem solving life of computers.  Since every day jobs in computers consist of just tons of problem solving, any experience of knowing how to get through different problems and errors makes the difference.  Learning about Radgrad and getting to use it for myself this past week has given me huge excitement because I am able to exponentially increase my skill ceiling in computers.  I am new to programming and computers currently, but I will do anything it takes to keep learning as much as possible.  Radgrad will definitely do just that.

The fact that Radgrad is a website that has all this information of different events, meetups, clubs, etc that will help me gain knowledge without having to ask that many people about getting connections is the best part about it in my opinion.  I also like how there are three categories of experience that give optimal balance of experience, and how you can plan events and classes up until the last semester you plan to be in college.  Everyone always talks about needing more than just grades in order to find a good job and have a good resume, and Radgrad is one of the only things that I know that facilitates all of this.  It seems that endless computer information and connections to experts can all be found on Radgrad, and it is a great tool that I will be sure to use to my advantage.

---

(39) The idea of Radgrad is a great idea for students to be able to learn more about their major and the computer science degree itself. It helps us look at potential careers and pathways that we can go through, based on our interests and what our schedules are like. It has certainly helped me a lot in choosing what courses I will be taking in the future, as well as the general pathway I will be pursuing after I get my degree as well. I also like the option to be able to see other people who has similar interests as I do, and maybe work together with them on assignments in order to help both of us out.

*One thing that I didn't like too much about Radgrad was the fact that you have to plan out almost everything in order to "complete" Radgrad.* For me, I didn't know too much about some of the interests that they list there, so I wasn't too sure what to put, as I didn't know my general path in this major. It kind of forced me to select a certain amount of interest and careers, while also making me fill out the meter on the top right.

---

(40) My RadGrad experience has been pretty good so far. I'm definitely going to continue exploring it and revising my profile. It's nice to know that I'm able to have access to so much information. Also, that I am able to see all of the local opportunities in the field, and even make connections with both groups and people. There was a lot that I didn't know was available at the UH Manoa.

I believe that RadGrad is a really great tool because it has information for all levels. It helps to be able to plan ahead, and have things to look forward to. I'm still not exactly sure what my end goal is yet. However, this experience helped me narrow down a general idea of what I am interested in, and what exactly is available at the school that I can explore in those areas. Overall, I think it's a really great tool.

---

(41) The experience was very good useful. Radgrad was very informational and helped me think of what I wanted to do. the process was very thorough and helped think of what I wanted to do or had interest in. It also gave me a lot future career ideas.

Radgrad gave me a lot of courses to choose from and opportunities to go after. It not only let me plan out my courses for the next year but basically for the entirety of my career to help become what I want to. It also gives recommendations of courses and opportunities to take to get closer to the future career.

(42) *At first glance, the interface and feel of RadGrad seemed very confusing.* However, as I selected my interests, it began to make more sense as RadGrad would highlight courses/opportunities that aligned with my interests. Additionally, I found it convenient that there were descriptions of everything and sometimes there were videos that were very helpful in learning more.

I would say that my experience with RadGrad was a positive one. It became easier to use the more time I spent on the website and I feel that it will be essential as a helpful tool in the future if I decide to pursue a career in the computer sciences. Also, to be able to view other student's interests helps me to see what classes others with similar interests are taking. Overall, I think RadGrad is a website every computer science-oriented student should utilize in improving their career.

(43) My experience working with RadGrad was decent. I assume it is okay that I went through the tutorial as if I would be going into the ICS major even though I am a psychology major. If that is not okay I feel that it should have been specified. The tutorial was fairly intuitive. For the purpose of getting used to the site, I feel that the tutorial was well made.

RadGrad itself definitely seemed helpful, especially for being able to see the opportunities list. Although I am not sure if it is feasible to have so many opportunities. The tutorial makes it seem like it might be necessary to reach 100 points in all three categories just in case that wasn't intended. *A suggestion I have is that as most people would probably be taking classes with star, it could be useful to be able to transfer class information between the two sites.*

(44) RadGrad makes networking with people with the same interest as you easy. RadGrad also helps students find jobs and opportunities after graduation.

(45) RadGrad presents a video, when you first open the website, convincing students to use RadGrad. The video was humorous and informative in only 1 minute, which I appreciated. It did actually convince me to use the website. As an undergraduate myself, I need the guidance. I think RadGrad can be of assist.

RadGrad presented many opportunities and courses that I didn't even know existed. I was confused about what courses there were or ways to put myself out there, so that I can get the hang of things ( CIS related), but thanks to the RadGrad, I know what the presenting opportunities are. I am inexperienced with the whole concept of computer science, but the website answers some of my questions.

Although RadGrad can be a good website for any student-- from undergraduate to graduate, I did have some technical difficulties with it. *It was very slow to load information I wanted to check out, even though the WiFi here is fast.  I would click on one tab, but it takes me to a different page, very different from the tab I chose. I would also add opportunities to my list, but it wouldn't let me, so I would have to keep trying until it does.*

(46) Browsing through RadGrad and looking through the opportunities and the courses offered by my university, I know that this website will strongly help me find my true career interest as I continue to study my computer science major. I am gradually leaning towards cyber security, and I am highly interested in the opportunities related to it. I will absolutely try to take those opportunities so that I can get a starting experience towards my career interest. I like that each module is descriptive and contains a list of the areas of interest, and those that are highlighted to indicate that it fits my interests.

I also enjoy that I can create my personal planner of future courses and opportunities to pursue, so that I have my set of goals in an organized fashion to be able to engage them step by step. With RadGrad's myICE, I can see what skills I need to improve on to become a successful undergraduate and future professional. With all the opportunities and the future that RadGrad offers me, I will gladly take advantage of it and find myself the career that perfectly suits me and my computer science interests.

(47) Being truly transparent, I haven't had much contact with RadGrad making my experience limited. My introduction to RadGrad occurred during class time, with a few minor tasks following. However, even with my lack of knowledge, I feel the site has some fantastic opportunities specific to the user, and I am no exception. I was happy to see it catered to my ICS major and recommended not only classes but extracurriculars, potential job opportunities, and even labs or camps. Also, sites that cater to each individual are usually very bare, meaning not much information is given besides the basics. I'm glad to say this wasn't the case. When looking into UHM courses, I could click through the class syllabus, instructors, participation, and other links to sites with even more information and talk about the precious sigh of relief that passed my lips. The only addition I feel could be helpful is to directly provide the course pathways/flow charts. This addition would make setting up the planners tab easier as you need to plan prerequisite courses, especially as you can gain the course information so quickly on the site.      In addition to the courses, I was excited looking into the opportunities tab. Generally, coding is thought to be a complex skill to obtain, unless you're entirely insane but just seeing the out-of-class help that is available through fun means makes it icing on the cake. I'm not usually the first to jump at organizations. I already find the ICS content challenging, but RadGrad actually seems to look into how these organizations present themselves and want to help with basics to complex applications. So I will most likely be joining a bunch of fun organizations starting with AMC Manoa.

(48) *I found the User interface to be confusing.* Especially on the courses. I had the 17 courses required, but it would still say I needed to improve. As well as the 6 opportunities. *I also wasn't really sure how to get more competency points.*

I did enjoy that it showed all possible ICS courses and opportunites like code for Hawaii and Purple Mai'a. I think that overall it is a good concept for a site. But I would like UHManoa to have an across the board site, instead of jumping to four different websites for a single course. *Also, maybe a heads up for next time, the website link in this assignment does not work.*

---

(49) Rad Grad was a helpful but somewhat confusing system that would help me progress my computer science. At first, everything was pretty straightforward for the setup process. I made an account and progressed through the rest of the checklist.

After finishing all that I was onto the career and opportunity showcase/planner which showed me how vast computer science truly is. I found a bunch of interesting opportunities such as ACM and career fairs. In the courses, I looked over robotics and software engineering. *The only thing I thought was confusing was the number of classes I could take in one semester because I still trying to figure out how to fulfill my degree requirement with non-CS classes.*

---

(50) I didn't go into starting my RadGrad profile with high hopes, but I did keep an open mind, especially after seeing how fruitful it could be to students looking to enrich their learning and experience, and even networking. The user walk-through was clear and the website is user friendly enough for me to have gotten out everything set up. I really enjoy the concept/goal of this site.

I found most courses to be geared towards computer science, which was to be expected of course, however as a mechanical engineer this proved to be less useful. Despite this, I am very interested in this branch of engineering, I always have been, and had I the kind of money to take classes I wanted purely for my own personal enrichment and not in relation to my career path, I would make much better use of RadGrad.

(51) My experience with RadGrad was eye-opening and shocking. At first, I was overwhelmed by the number of opportunities provided for me throughout my college years. In addition, it made me realize the number of professions that I could choose from by completing my computer science degree. I always thought that I could only choose from being a programmer for a company or be a game developer. However, after going through RadGrad, I can view the many professions I could choose, creating a wider variety of opportunities.

Speaking of opportunities, RadGrad made me also acknowledge that I need to start building up my experience. I didn't know there were so many projects and competitions that were related to coding and programming. In addition, it made me also realize that I have a long way to go to gain the required knowledge and skill to be more prepared after college. Overall, RadGrad was an experience that I am grateful for as it made me realize what's to come and made me more mentally ready for the rest of college.

(52) My Rad Grad experience was extremely insightful into the courses, syllabus (if available), possible extra curriculars, and career goals. Although I am only a minor in Computer Science and majoring in Finance at Shidler, I found this exercise extremely helpful. In paragraph two, I will cover what I learned from this and in paragraph three I will give feedback towards the program.

What I found most helpful and interesting about RadGrad was the fact that I was able to see individual career paths and what they are most associated with as well as recommended courses. They did the same for the different extracurriculars as well, but I found it most interesting for possible job opportunities. For example, one of the recommendations for the “Business Plan Competition”, entrepreneurship was recommended. I think being able to visually see all requirements, possible extracurricular activities, as well as ICS focus professions (since ICS is so wide).

With this exercise what I found it lacked was kids who knew exactly what they wanted to do. I understand that RadGrad is created for people who don't necessarily know what they want to do but for the students who have already had internships or job experience, I think this should be a viable option. To go deeply into one specific field, see all the extracurricular activities that help as well as possible job opportunities after. This would be fairly easy to implement but *something that could be a long-term goal for RadGrad would be to implement it with multiple “popular” degree programs at UH.* For example, Business, STEM, communications, etc. This way students who are double majoring can see what overlaps they might have in certain opportunities. This could also be the same for students majoring in one field but minoring in another. For example, majoring in Finance and minoring in Computer Science, Investment Banking Analyst could be a very viable opportunity. I know this would require a lot of work, but I feel that it would help UH students immensely and reduce the confusion that some students have. Some students go through their college degrees only to realize that there are little to no high paying jobs available after school. For example, someone in International Business, although Shidler College of Business is known for this, there are not many viable (realistic) jobs in Hawaii that are heavily related to it. In don’t think this would deter students from attaining these high-level degrees but it might incentivize them to also minor or major in another field that could help them combine their degrees for the perfect job.

(53) As an NSE student, most of RadGrad does not match my progress towards graduating as I am still working towards my degree at my home campus. However, I wish that my school the University of Minnesota had a system like this. This is a very streamlined process that has extracurriculars right there that would be very helpful even after the degree. At my home school, all of these resources are on different websites and can be hard to find and figure out, especially degree progress and which courses need to be taken, and in which order. I have mostly figured it out by now but it has taken me quite some time. My biggest issue was with transfer credits, but as I am here right now I got it all sorted out.

---

(54) After using RadGrad, I think it would be very helpful to students who have a clear plan of what they want to do in the future. It provides a wide selection of courses and opportunities to be seen and allows them to find out what they can do during the school year and the summer.

*However, RadGrad gave me a bit of trouble when using it, because I wasn't exactly sure of my plan in college.* I'm not sure if I want to be involved in all those events, and yet RadGrad forces me to include those opportunities. I don't think my plan would be accurate because of several events that I added just to fulfill myICE. *I also think that myICE is a little difficult to understand for a new user who doesn't know that there is a documentation to RadGrad, and that the purpose of it could be stated somewhere more plain in sight.*

---

(55) RadGrad is a kind of planning website. It can make my goals clearer and let me know what should I do next. It is also very helpful for some career planning. I have a career I want to be but I don't know what kind of course I need to learn. There give the corresponding courses and some training for me. I can also look at different professions about my major.

This website also allows me to meet people who have the same hobbies as me. I can also get more information from those people about their courses and careers. I can also search for internships related to me, although I haven't found one yet.
