## Overview

In order to gain insight into the essays by ICS 111, 211, and 314 students, I propose that we perform "coding".  An overview of this process is described in [Essential Guide to Coding Qualitative Data](https://delvetool.com/guide). The process that I propose we follow is this:

  1. I have read through the essays, and generated an initial set of coding categories (specified below). 
  2. Cam, Peter, and Seungoh perform their own read-through, and suggest modifications to this initial set.
  3. We come up with a final set of coding categories. 
  4. We now each read approximately half of the essays, this time indicating all of the coding categories referenced in the essay via a spreadsheet.  This means that each essay will be coded by two people.
  5. Philip will combine the spreadsheets into a single spreadsheet that shows the results of coding for each essay. 
  6. Philip writes an initial "interpretation" and distributes for review and improvement.
  7. The final interpretation is incorporated into the upcoming Journal article. (And IUSE poster, if we get done in time).


## Coding categories

Here are the initial set of coding categories.  For each category, I provide example quotes from essays to illustrate the kinds of text that would lead to that code being assigned to that essay.

Please provide a "1" in the category to indicate positive agreement.  We can do a separate pass later to look for the negative comments (which are pretty rare).

### 0. RadGrad is "amazing", "awesome" (and/or "overwhelming", "confusing")
(Note: I don't think we have to manually code up this category; I can look for the occurrence of those words automatically. These words came up frequently enough that I think it will be useful to code for them explicitly.)

* "RadGrad is an amazing tool for ICS Students."
* "All in all, RadGrad is a pretty amazing site"
* "Radgrad is an awesome friendly user interface"
* "RadGrad is awesome!"
* "Overall, I think that RadGrad is and will be an amazing resource for students like me to use in planning their classes for the next 4 years. "
* "The first time I encountered RadGrad, I felt very overwhelmed. "
* "My first experience about RadGrad is that I need to understand my plan about my ICS life and with that being said it is a little bit overwhelming."

### 1. RadGrad provides useful information

This coding category might not turn out to be useful, because I didn't see any users that didn't find RadGrad to be useful in my initial sample. However, feel free to code it as you wish. 

* "I was surprised by the sheer amount of information that I was able to find."

### 2. The course explorer is useful

Any positive comments related to "courses" gets a "1" for this coding category. 

* "Being able to see all the possible ICS courses I could take was also particularly helpful."

### 3. The opportunity explorer is useful

Any positive comments related to "opportunities" or "extra-curriculars" gets a "1" for this coding category.


* "The opportunities tasks were also quite interesting."

### 4. The career goals explorer is useful

Any positive comments related to "careers" or "career goals" or "professional goals" gets a "1" for this coding category.


* "I found it extremely useful to see which career goals fit my selected interests"

### 5. The interests explorer is useful

Any positive comments related to "interests" gets a "1" for this coding category.


* "My favorite part of the whole RadGrad experience was looking into what my interests are because I discovered a bunch of different skills/interests that I did not even know existed!"

### 6. The degree planner is useful

Any positive comments related to "planning" or "professional planning" gets a "1" for this coding category.


* "I also like the degree planner because I got to read the descriptions of the different ICS classes that I can take. It also organizes the classes and opportunities by semester which I think is very helpful because it helps me visualize the classes I should be taking and the time I have."

* "A con I found was that I didn't plan on taking so much classes (maybe one or two more after this class) in ICS but it made me add a bunch of classes to complete the task even though I was hesitant on adding so many courses."

### 7. The game mechanics (ICE points, Levels) are useful.

Any positive comments related to "game-like" or ICE or Levels gets a "1" for this coding category.


* "I also believe trying to rack up ICE points makes the experience a lot more enjoyable. "
* "The ability to "level up" is personally enticing, as well."
* "One thing that I didn't like too much about Radgrad was the fact that you have to plan out almost everything in order to "complete" Radgrad."
* "This ability to check off the boxes needed is a positive way to stay motivated and chip away at goals. "
* "Finally, the whole idea of this is to help people succeed in computer science which it does but seems like the program to set up courses immediately feels like it's trying to rush in and dictate your future. This is due to the fact that the high priority section still can have people undecided and hold back points because of that."

### 8. Course and/or Opportunity Reviews are useful

Any positive comments related to "reviews" or "feedback gets a "1" for this coding category.


* "Being able to see other peopleâ€™s reviews and see their experiences has also proven to be very useful in helping me decide which courses and opportunities I would like to try."

### 9. RadGrad provides useful information for women and/or underrepresented groups.

Any positive comments related specifically to women or underrepresented gets a "1" for this coding category.


* "I did not realize the number of opportunities that UH Manoa offered for women and minorities. "

### 10. RadGrad is well-designed and easy to use.

Any positive comments related to the ease of use or design or layout of the system gets a "1" for this coding category.

* "I was surprised how easy RadGrad was to use. The design of it was very pleasing to the eye and easy to navigate."
* "When I first got on RadGrad, I was a bit confused because I didn't know where to log in, as well as how to use the website."
* "No matter how many "opportunities" i added, then put in my degree planner, it would not remove it from the "priorities" category. "

### 11. I will use RadGrad in future.

Any positive comments related to coming back to RadGrad, or revisiting it gets a "1" for this coding category.



* "I can absolutely see myself using throughout my undergraduate experience."

### 12. There are issues regarding design commonalities between STAR and RadGrad.

Any comments related to the interaction (positive or negative) between STAR and RadGrad gets a "1" for this coding category.


* "At first, however, it was very complicated to get through the degree planner section. I lined up my schedule on RadGrad that meets the graduation requirements on my STAR GPS but it said it was not completed."

* "a planner that is 50000000x better than STAR is super awesome."

### 13. RadGrad helps create communities of practice.

Any positive comments related to the ability of RadGrad to connect students with other students, to network with professionals, or to work with others gets a "1" for this coding category.


* "What I also like about RadGrad is that we can find like-minded people to work on creation of projects together."
* "I also like the feature to allow others to see your interests and shared pathways. This can lead to collaboration which is very beneficial for personal and career growth."
* "This website also allows me to meet people who have the same hobbies as me. I can also get more information from those people about their courses and careers."

### 14. Internships are important in RadGrad.

Any comments (pro or con) related to internships gets a "1" for this coding category.


* "I wish I could see the internship opportunities because one thing I learned from my siblings is that interning is very important."

### 15. RadGrad broadened my perspective on computer science.

Any positive comments related RadGrad exposing the student to new ideas, courses, opportunities, etc. that they didn't know about before warrants a "1" for this coding category.


* "It truly opened up my eyes to the many things open for me to further my college experience."
* "There were a lot of options for interests and career goals which I find very helpful to a novice in the field of computer science."
* "There was a lot that I didn't know was available at the UH Manoa."
* "RadGrad presented many opportunities and courses that I didn't even know existed."
