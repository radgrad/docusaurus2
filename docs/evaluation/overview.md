This section of the site contains evaluation data on RadGrad from the 2021-2022 academic year. 

There are two types of evaluation data. The first type involves students in first, second, or third semester classes being asked to go through the New Student Tutorial and write a short essay about their initial exposure to RadGrad. Here are summary statistics for this form of evaluation: 

| Class     | Total Students | Responses | Percentage |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| 111, F21  | 204            | 55        | 27%        |
| 111, S22  | 42             | 41        | 97%        |
| 211, S22  | 136            | 42        | 31%        |
| 314, F21  | 56             | 25        | 45%        |
| 314, S22  | 37             | 24        | 65%        |
| **Total** | **475**        | **187**   | **39%**    |

This data provides information about "first contact" with RadGrad as a student.

The second type of evaluation involved asking students who graduated in Fall 21 or are expected to graduate in Spring 22 to fill out a short questionnaire. The goal here is to find out what impact RadGrad had on the degree experience by students who are completing their degree.

We contacted 107 of these "graduating" students, and 23 students replied, for a response rate of 21%.
