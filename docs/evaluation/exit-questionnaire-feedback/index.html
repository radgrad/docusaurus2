Are those reviews visible for upcoming students? If not already, that would be a good feature to add.</li><li>The balance of technical and experience</li><li>I found out that there were many opportunities available locally (Hawaii). When I think of ICS related positions the first place that come into my mind is the mainland or other countries. Thus, it is nice to see opportunities available in Hawaii.</li><li>I learned different opportunities in the community, such as possible internships and competitions. I also learned other students&#x27; opinions of classes, as well as legacy ICS classes that haven&#x27;t been offered since before I arrived at UH.</li><li>I learned more about opportunities, what type of cs jobs exist and general info about courses I could/will take.</li><li>Personally, the degree planner I found extremely convenient and made setting up courses for future semesters easier.</li><li>Generally heard about new opportunities and experiences that I would have probably missed  otherwise.</li><li>Remembering RadGrad it taught me about the importance of extracurricular activities.</li><li>Opportunities such as workshops, internship opportunities and other extracurricular activities.</li><li>Nothing (11 times)</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="what-could-we-add-to-radgrad-to-make-it-more-useful-to-future-students"></a>What could we add to RadGrad to make it more useful to future students?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#what-could-we-add-to-radgrad-to-make-it-more-useful-to-future-students" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li><p>Access to reviews and tips from students either working in certain CS jobs or doing some sort of higher education (masters, doctorate) to get a sense of what to expect with that major later in your career.</p></li><li><p>More advertisement and rewards variety based on the myICE level.</p></li><li><p>RadGrad would be useful if it had links to jobs/careers where they can apply in the career page depending on the job selected making it similar to a job board but only for the major that&#x27;s related.</p></li><li><p>&quot;I think having a larger focus on degree planning would help (although I know there already is a large focus on this). STAR does a decent job of listing the classes you need to take in order to graduate, but seeing all the different ICS courses for each of the different specialty tracks would be beneficial. I think it would also be a cool idea to offer an exploration of the pros and cons, possible jobs, and actual skillsets of each of the different tracks (ex: common tech stacks for data science careers versus security careers).  I have spent way too long looking at the ICS graduation requirement forms to plan every single credit possible and optimizing my semesters so I got to explore some of the data science track without having to commit myself to that track as a means of figuring out what specifically I want to do within the domain of ICS. However, that took an exceptional amount  of time to do, and it would be a great idea to have some way of communicating these experiences with new students. This might be in a similar style to a blog post, or a list of personal anecdotes and recommendations for navigating the ICS degree? (The best example I can think of is taking MATH 301/307/372 instead of ICS 141/142 to allow me to do either the data analysis track or the general track, and taking electives like ICS 435 Machine Learning early on to get a feel if I want to switch to the data science track before it was too late to make the change) Finally, I think having a section on non-ICS classes would be a good idea. Students could recommend electives that they took that fills multiple different graduation requirements, suggest what type of classes they were able to manage in one semester (ex: not taking three other intense classes when taking ICS 311), or even explore non-ICS classes that they could get an override to count towards their degree (ex: one of my favorite classes I&#x27;ve taken was EE 491F - Software Reverse Engineering, and I was able to use it as an ICS 400+ elective. I know there are some classes like this in other fields that could be given an override as well).&quot;</p></li><li><p>I feel like the ICS courses on RadGrad should be updated every semester to reflect the availability of the courses per semester. Not all ICS courses are taught every semester so I think it would be helpful to update RadGrad to reflect the current availability.</p></li><li><p>Im not sure since I only used it once</p></li><li><p>More incentive to use it.</p></li><li><p>Perhaps a page that leads to resources that can help students for specific classes. Reviews should also be anonymous.</p></li><li><p>Not sure, to be honest. I found RadGrad to be perfect as is.</p></li><li><p>Nothing</p></li><li><p>I think it just needs to be indoctrinated early on. I didn&#x27;t use it personally because I heard about it too late into my ICS studies and didn&#x27;t want to put everything in.</p></li><li><p>More simplistic UI and mechanism. I feel like there is too much going on.</p></li><li><p>RadGrad could possibly be promoted more in other classes and by other professors.  Clarification could also be made on how to verify points.  I recall engaging in opportunities that could contribute towards my ICE points but I was unable to quickly locate instructions on how to verify them.</p></li><li><p>Adding additional electives that could apply for ICS courses (ex. EE 491 could be a ICS 400 elective).</p></li><li><p>I think if there is an app version of RadGrad, it would be really cool, and I would probably use it a lot more. I also think if there are email notifications of opportunity from RadGrad would be useful.</p></li><li><p>If it were possible to integrate STAR into the planning section it would be helpful to see the courses that have actually already been completed instead of having to integrate it manually.</p></li><li><p>In my opinion more mandatory involvement, hindsight is 20/20 and I believe there are those students who may not realize how useful RadGrad is.</p></li><li><p>A more convenient way to redeem points/level up, as well as internship opportunities outside of the state.</p></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="is-there-anything-else-youd-like-to-tell-us-about-radgrad"></a>Is there anything else you&#x27;d like to tell us about RadGrad?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#is-there-anything-else-youd-like-to-tell-us-about-radgrad" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li><p>&quot;This could be a powerful tool to improve STEM departments. Listen to the students and their course reviews. There are still professors in the CS departments that are unable to teach due to either lack of teaching or even the inability to properly speak english. &quot;</p></li><li><p>The RadGrad Summer Internship, depsite, being online was a useful experience as it gave me a better preview on working from home because of ongoing events.</p></li><li><p>Everything looks good compared to the last time I had used it 2-3 years ago. Also there is a bug in the career section where if you want to check the all the visible students the show less button word is missing and when clicking it the show more button is also missing.</p></li><li><p>I was introduced to RadGrad the semester after I switched to the ICS department, so by that point I had already done fairly extensive research into the possible pathways, ICS classes, and local opportunities (having Gerald Lau as an advisor contributed to 90% of this). However, having all of this information in one place is an excellent idea for incoming students. I was able to use RadGrad to verify that I was in fact on the right course and getting what I wanted out of the degree, but I think new students will be able to get a ton out of it!</p></li><li><p>Overall, I enjoyed the RadGrad application and has helped me figure out what courses I should take and how it could impact my future when it comes to looking for job opportunities.</p></li><li><p>Many people I know don&#x27;t use radgrad, perhaps there is a way to better advertise it?</p></li><li><p>I feel like RadGrad should be used alongside STAR, as both fulfill class requirement purposes, and RadGrad can complement/supplement additional activities to help with a student&#x27;s degree path.</p></li><li><p>I am not entirely up to date with RadGrad, but from the last time I used it, the one thing I thought to myself is if it can be more focused on helping students get jobs/internships. I am aware that there is a section, but it was lackluster. Have a section that contains internships &amp; new grad jobs that can be filtered by student year (freshmen, sophmore, etc.). Have wide ranges of internships and jobs from local to out of state. Provide links to courses that teach students how to interview and what to study for interviews in both behavioral and technical aspects.</p></li><li><p>RadGrad is great for looking at numerical progression for your Innovation, Competence, and Experience levels throughout your University career. However, the incentive to continue using RadGrad outside of a Lab introducing it to new students wasn&#x27;t there. I looked at RadGrad during my first semester of ICS classes and was like &quot;Guess I&#x27;m here&quot; and didn&#x27;t bother elaborating further on it.</p></li><li><p>Showcasing the job searching process along side RadGrad may help some consider it more useful. For example, most Indeed job applications require 2+ years of &quot;programing&quot; experience outside of any educational institution. That may help some students realize how pivotal RadGrad can be to ensuring a successful future.  </p></li><li><p>Is helpful when looking for opportunities and class reviews, but I prefer to use STAR. </p></li></ul></div></article><div class="margin-vert--xl"><div class="row"><div class="col"></div><div class="col text--right"><em><small>Last updated on <time datetime="2022-04-04T21:26:52.000Z" class="docLastUpdatedAt_217_">4/4/2022</time> by <strong>Philip Johnson</strong></small></em></div></div></div><div class="margin-vert--lg"><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/evaluation/314-s22-feedback"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« ICS 314, Spring 22</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/evaluation/instrumentation"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">RadGrad Instrumentation Data Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_3SO_"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#overview" class="table-of-contents__link">Overview</a></li><li><a href="#questions" class="table-of-contents__link">Questions</a><ul><li><a href="#do-you-recall-ever-using-the-radgrad-system" class="table-of-contents__link">Do you recall ever using the RadGrad System?</a></li><li><a href="#about-how-many-times-did-you-login-to-radgrad-on-average-over-the-past-two-years" class="table-of-contents__link">About how many times did you login to RadGrad on average over the past two years?</a></li><li><a href="#do-you-feel-your-use-of-radgrad-was-affected-by-covid-if-so-please-explain" class="table-of-contents__link">Do you feel your use of RadGrad was affected by COVID?
