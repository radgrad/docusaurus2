Once you have implemented a pilot instance of RadGrad for your domain, the final step of the Needs Assessment process is to perform a pilot study.

The pilot study involves a "guided tour" of your instance, similar to the [Guided Tour of the RadGrad Demo Instance](../../users/demo/overview), in which you walk selected students, faculty, and advisors through your RadGrad instance and get their feedback on whether the system appears to add value and solve problems for your disciplinary area.

If you have gotten to this point in the RadGrad Needs Assessment process, please contact the RadGrad Project team and we will help you move forward with the design of the pilot study.
