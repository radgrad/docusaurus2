Building the pilot instance involves standing up a new instance of RadGrad, and then populating it with Interests, Career Goals, Courses, and Opportunities from your sketch.

You'll also need to create some sample users that illustrate students at various points in their degree program, and some sample advisors and faculty.

The result will be a RadGrad instance similar to the RadGrad Demo instance, as discussed in [Guided Tour of the RadGrad Demo Instance](../../users/demo/overview).

If you have gotten to this point in the RadGrad Needs Assessment process, please contact the RadGrad Project team and we will help you move forward.
