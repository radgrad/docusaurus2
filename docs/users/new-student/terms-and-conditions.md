In order to use RadGrad, you need to review and accept the Terms and Conditions.

To do this, scroll down to see the Terms and Conditions checklist:

Click on the link to go to the Terms and Conditions page, which will look similar to this:

To use RadGrad, you must agree to adhere to a Code of Conduct.

In addition, you must agree to make your name and email address visible to everyone who has been registered to use this RadGrad instance. This is crucial to enabling RadGrad to achieve one of its fundamental goals: helping you to find others with similar interests to create communities of practice.

To agree to the terms, please click the `I consent to the Terms and Conditions` button. You can then continue to use RadGrad.

If you don't agree, click the `I don't consent to the Terms and Conditions` button. You will be logged out and an email will be sent to the administrator to delete your information.

Periodically, a RadGrad Administrator will check to ensure that all registered students have accepted the Terms and Conditions, so please review and either accept or reject them as soon as possible.

Assuming you've agreed to the Terms and Conditions, let's now go on to another checklist item: Interests.

If you reject the terms and conditions, but reconsider and want to use RadGrad, contact your instructor or advisor to get you re-registered with the system. No worries!
