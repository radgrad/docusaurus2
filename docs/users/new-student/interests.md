When you first start using RadGrad, there will be a checklist item that asks you to add at least three Interests to your profile:

Interests represent a set of discipline-specific topics relevant to the degree experience. Adding interests to your profile is very important, because it helps RadGrad help make better recommendations and helps you find others who share them with you.

### The Interests Explorer page

To add Interests to your profile, click on the link in the checklist item to take you to the Interests Explorer. It will look similar to this:

There can be a lot of Interests---in this instance, there are almost 80.  I told you that computer science and engineering is diverse!

You can filter the interests, sort them, or search by title.

Each interest has a name and a brief description. If you want to learn more and add the interest to your profile click the `See Details / Add to Profile` button.

### The Interests Details page

Here is an example Interests Details page:
