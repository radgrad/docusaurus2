The degree experience planner allows you to plan your four-year **RadGrad Degree Experience** experience. Your goal should be a plan that gets you to a **myICE** score of 100 Innovation, 100 Competency, and 100 Experience points. You can earn Innovation and Experience points from Opportunities and Competency points from Courses.

This is your canvas for creating an exciting plan to get you to 100, 100, 100.

The right-hand box has three tabs, opportunities (light bulb), courses (book), and Internships (coming soon). These tabs show the opportunities and courses in your profile.

Let's start with Opportunities. Click on an opportunity to open it up.

Now let's work on courses. Click on the Courses (book) tab.

Drag the blue course pill into the semester you plan on taking the course. You should probably only plan on taking 2 or 3 ICS courses per semester. When you drop the course in a semester it is removed from the choices on the right.

If you run out of courses in your profile, you can go back to the Courses Explorer and add more courses to your profile.
