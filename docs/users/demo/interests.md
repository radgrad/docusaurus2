title: Interests Page

Clicking on the "Interests" tab in the nav bar takes you to a page like this:

![](/img/user-guide/demo/interests.png)

This page provides an overview of the "Interests", or discipline-specific topic areas, for this instance of RadGrad.

It is important for students to have at least a few Interests added to their profile so that the system can make recommendations and support the development of communities of practice.

As you can see, "Algorithms" is an interest area for Dora. Let's click on the "See Details/Remove from Profile" button to take a closer look:

There is quite a bit of information on this page:
  * A short text defining what an algorithm is.
  * A short YouTube video describing algorithms.
  * Career Goals, Courses, and Opportunities related to algorithms. Each of those tiles are clickable and will take you to a page describing them.
  * (Visible) Students. For FERPA-compliance, students must opt-in to sharing information about their Interests within the system. In this case, three students (including Dora) have opted-in.
  * (Related) Faculty.  Faculty that have listed algorithms as a specialty area are indicated here.

Just like Career Goals, Courses, and Opportunities, you can click on Users to obtain more information. Let's check this out next.
