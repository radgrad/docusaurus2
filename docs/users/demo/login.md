To login to the UHM/DEMO instance, please navigate in your browser to [https://radgrad.dev](https://radgrad.dev). You should get to a landing page that looks similar to this:

![](/img/user-guide/demo/landing.png)

The most important part is that the upper right corner says "RADGRAD (UHM/DEMO)".

In the UHM/DEMO instance, you can login as any user with the same password.  To avoid the potential for shenanigans, we're not stating the password in this document. Instead, please contact a member of the RadGrad team to find out what the "generic" UHM/DEMO password is.

A good way to start understanding the system is to login as a hypothetical student who has used the system successfully and is at the end of their undergraduate experience.  In UHM/DEMO, that kind of student is represented by `dora@hawaii.edu`.

To login as Dora, click on the "LOGIN" button at the top left of the landing page, select "... as a student", and then enter `dora@hawaii.edu` as the user name and the password we have supplied you for all users. Once you've logged in, you should see Dora's home page, which we discuss on the next page.

:::tip Demo Dive
At the conclusion of this guided tour, you might want to try logging in as one of the other students. But it's easiest to start learning about RadGrad by seeing what a "good" RadGrad student's account looks like.
