title: "From profile to practice: the degree planner"
sidebar_label: Degree Plan

One function of the Explorers presented in the last page was to learn about the discipline, and about the student and faculty community associated with that discipline.

Another function of the Explorers is to enable a student to indicate which of these entities appeal to them by putting them in their profile.

Once that's done, the next step is to organize things into a coherent Degree Plan, or "Degree Experience", which includes a combination of Courses and Opportunities (and, in future, Internships) related to one's chosen Interests and Career Goals.

Here's what the Degree Planner page looks like:

The basic idea of the Degree Planner is to take the Courses and Opportunities from your profile that are listed in the right side pane, and drop them into specific semesters in the left side pane.

Once you've indicated a specific future semester (or quarter, if RadGrad is configured to display quarters rather than semesters), then the ICE Points associated with that Course or Opportunities will contribute to your "Planned" ICE Point total.

RadGrad requires the ability to query an institutional database for courses a student has completed in the past. That way, the student does not have to enter finished courses into their Degree Plan, and the system can award the ICE Points associated with a completed course automatically.

We've been referencing ICE Points in the past couple of pages, so let's look at that page next.
