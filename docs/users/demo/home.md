title: Home Page and To Do List
sidebar_label: Home Page

After logging in as Dora, you will see Dora's Home Page, which should look similar to this:

![](/img/user-guide/demo/home.png)

In RadGrad, the Home Page is a smart "To Do" list.  Each time you visit the Home Page, RadGrad analyzes the state of the system and your profile to figure out whether or not there are useful activities for you to carry out in order to make the most of RadGrad.

In the case of Dora, an experienced user, there is only 1 High Priority item (request points for a completed Opportunity).

Clicking on the "Medium Priority" tab shows other activities she might want to work on:

![](/img/user-guide/demo/home-2.png)

And clicking on the "Completed" tab shows other possible activities that are fine for now:

![](/img/user-guide/demo/home-3.png)

The goal of the Home Page To Do List is to essentially "teach" users how to use RadGrad simply by taking care of To Do list items.

Let's now look at some of the other pages in the system available through the navigation bar.
