Clicking on a user tile in any page brings up a modal dialog with more information about that user. For example, by clicking on the user tile labeled "Abigail Kealoha", the following dialog box will overlay the contents of the current page until you click OK:

This is one way that RadGrad supports the creation of communities of practice: students can find others who share similar interests, career goals, and so forth.

In RadGrad, the only information that students must share by default is their name and their email address.  When a user logs in for the first time, they are asked to agree to "Terms and Conditions" which asks that they comply with student code of conduct and also to allow their name and email address to be shared with others. If they do not want to do this, then they can are logged out and will not appear in the system.

Users can opt-in to sharing additional information, and the above hypothetical user (Abigail) illustrates a user who has uploaded a picture, provided a link to her professional portfolio page, revealed her Level, ICE Points, and her current selected Interests, Career Goals, Courses, and Opportunities. (The Visibility Page allows each user to changes these settings at any time).
