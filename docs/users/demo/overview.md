title: Overview of the RadGrad Demo Instance
sidebar_label: Overview
---

This chapter provides a brief introduction to the RadGrad "UHM/DEMO" instance, a "sandbox" version of RadGrad that allows the public to login as a variety of users to get a more realistic sense for the user experience.

Please note that the Demo Instance may differ in slight ways from the descriptions below. Also, since it is possible for people to login and then change the state of users, the state of any user might differ in small ways from what you see here. We will re-initialize the Demo Instance database occasionally, but it's fine for folks to play around with the state of users in order to better understand how things work.

The UHM/DEMO instance defines the following users with the following roles:

* 1 admin (`radgrad@hawaii.edu`)
* 3 advisors (`cmoore@hawaii.edu`, `johnson@hawaii.edu`, and `kennydq@hawaii.edu`)
* 16 faculty (including `scottpr@hawaii.edu`, `guylaine@hawaii.edu`, and `henric@hawaii.edu`)
* 6 students (`abi@hawaii.edu`, `alfred@hawaii.edu`, `betty@hawaii.edu`, `charley@hawaii.edu`, `dora@hawaii.edu`, and `ella@hawaii.edu`)

It also defines approximately:

* 19 Career Goals
* 78 Interests
* 50 Opportunities
* 106 Courses

The advisor and faculty user definitions loosely reflect actual faculty at the University of Hawaii Department of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS), and the Career Goal, Interest, Opportunity, and Course definitions are all taken from a recent snapshot of the production RadGrad database for the ICS Department.

However, it is very important to note the the six student definitions in UHM/DEMO are totally hypothetical. They are defined in such a way as to illustrate students at various points in their academic program.

This chapter is best used "interactively": please obtain the password for the UHM/DEMO instance, and then login to https://radgrad.dev and explore the system as you read through the accompanying pages. The screenshots are just examples and there are additional features you can discover by interacting with the system.

The next 10 pages take you through the major features of RadGrad from the student perspective. The last half dozen pages will show you the additional features available to Faculty and Advisors. To understand those capabilities, it's best that you first be familiar with the system from the student's point of view.
