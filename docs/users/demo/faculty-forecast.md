title: Forecasting future involvement in Courses and Opportunities
sidebar_label: Forecasts (Faculty)
---

One interesting value-added of RadGrad is the ability to easily learn about the future plans of students.  Faculty and Advisors can access the "Forecasts" page.

For example:

![](/img/user-guide/demo/forecasts.png)

The Forecasts page provides two tables, one for Courses and one for Opportunities.  Each table lists all of the associated Courses (or Opportunities), along with the number of students who have indicated that the plan to participate in that Course or Opportunity over the next two academic years.

The Forecast page can help Faculty anticipate future demand for Courses, helping with curriculum design. It also helps them to see what Opportunities are popular among students, which potentially could motivate curriculum changes to better address student interests.

For the UHM/DEMO instance, with only six students, the data on this page is not very interesting!
