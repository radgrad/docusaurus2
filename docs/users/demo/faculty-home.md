Now that you understand the RadGrad experience from the perspective of a student, let's take a quick look at the experience as a Faculty member.

To do this, logout from the system, and then login as a faculty member (`esb@hawaii.edu`).

After logging in, the following page for the faculty member will appear:

Just like for students, the Home Page for faculty is a smart "To Do" list.  Unlike students, several of the Faculty To Do items are specific to the Faculty role.
