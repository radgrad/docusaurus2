One of the most important goals of RadGrad is to help build "communities of practice": students, faculty, advisors, and community groups who share a common interest and want to help each other develop proficiency with it.

RadGrad provides a "Visibility" mechanism to allow you to control what aspects of your profile are visible to others. The Home Page checklist item asks you to review your Visibility settings if you are a new user, and every six months or so thereafter:

Clicking on the "Visibility" navbar link (or the Visibility Page button in the checklist item) takes you to your Visibilty page. Here's what it looks like for this advisor:

There are six parts of your profile that you can make available: a picture, a link to your home page, and any Interests, Career Goals, Courses, and Opportunities that you have in your profile.

:::info Pro Tip
While it is voluntary, we hope that you will share as much information about yourself as you feel comfortable.  Remember that each RadGrad instance is a private, invitation-only community. You are only sharing this information with other folks within your RadGrad instance.
