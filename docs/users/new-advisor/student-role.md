As an advisor who is new to RadGrad, the first step is to familiarize yourself with how students use RadGrad.  To do that, please go through the [Guided Tour of the RadGrad Demo Instance](../demo/overview). This will take 10-15 minutes.

It will probably be sufficient for this tutorial to just read through the pages in that Guided Tour. However, if you want to go further into the student experience by logging into the demo instance, then please contact a RadGrad administrator and they can give you the password.

:::tip Goal for this tutorial page

1. What will students gain from using RadGrad?
2. What are examples of Interests, Career Goals, Courses, and Opportunities?
3. What is myICE?  How do students earn Innovation, Competency, and Experience points?
4. How does the RadGrad Degree Plan differ from your department's degree program checklist?
