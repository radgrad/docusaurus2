After logging in you will see your Home Page, which should look similar to this:

![](/img/user-guide/f21/home.png)

In RadGrad, the Home Page is a smart "To Do" list.  Each time you visit the Home Page, RadGrad analyzes the state of the system and your profile to figure out whether there are useful activities for you to carry out in order to make the most of RadGrad. One goal of the Home Page To Do List is to "teach" new users how to use RadGrad simply by taking care of To Do list items.

Another goal is to help you notice new changes to the system. For example, if new career goals or opportunities that are related to your interests appear, then this page can notify you to go look for them.

The first thing you need to do is scroll down and accept or reject the Terms and Conditions.

If you agree to the terms click the `I consent to the Terms and Conditions` button. You can then continue to use RadGrad. 

If you don't agree click the terms click the `I don't consent to the Terms and Conditions` button. You will be logged out and an email is sent to the administrator to delete your information.

Hopefully, you agree to the Terms and Conditions.

Let's now work on your interests.
