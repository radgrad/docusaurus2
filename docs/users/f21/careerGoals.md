Currently, RadGrad has 20 different career goals related to Computer Science. The Career Goals Explorer looks very similar to the Interests Explorer.

You can filter the career goals showing all of them, the ones in your profile, or the ones not in your profile.

You can sort them alphabetically, recommended based upon your interests, or by the most recent updated.

Lastly, you can search the names of the career goals by typing in the Search field.

Each career goal has a name and a brief description. If you want to learn more and add the career goal to your profile click the `See Details / Add to Profile` button.

For example, here is the Data Scientist details page.

that share this career goal's interests.

It's worth spending some time on the Career Goal Explorer. Read through the different Career Goals. If it is interesting to you click the Add to Profile button. If you add a career goal to your profile RadGrad will ask you if you want to add the career goal's interests to you profile also.
