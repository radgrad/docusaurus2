The Visibility Page allows you to control what information others see about you.

![Visibility Page](/img/user-guide/f21/visibility.png)

By default, we only share your name and email.

The left-hand column's check-boxes allow you to share more information. You can share your picture, personal website, profile interests, profile career goals, profile courses, profile opportunities, level, and myICE points. Changing what you share changes your label and profile card that others see.

:::tip RadGrad walk-through
Play around with the different visibility settings. When you are happy with your label and profile you're done. You can always change the settings later.
