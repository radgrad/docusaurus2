The right-hand box has three tabs, opportunities (light bulb), courses (book), and Internships (coming soon). These tabs show the opportunities and courses in your profile.

Let's start with Opportunities. Click on an opportunity to open it up.

Add you add opportunities to your plan your **myICE** points update. You can see your **myICE** points in the header.

The number in the center is earned value the circle on the outside shows how many points you've planned.

Now let's work on courses. Click on the Courses (book) tab.

Drag the blue course pill into the semester you plan on taking the course. You should probably only plan on taking 2 or 3 ICS courses per semester. When you drop the course in a semester it is removed from the choices on the right.
