Currently, RadGrad has over 50 opportunities. Opportunities represent extra-curricular activities that help a student progress toward one or more Career Goals and/or learn more about a specific Interest. The set of Opportunities are "curated" by faculty members to ensure quality and relevance.

You can filter, sort, and search opportunities.

The most useful sort is by recommended. RadGrad will sort all the opportunities based your profile interests.
