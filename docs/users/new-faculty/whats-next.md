If you've been able to successfully follow the tutorial, your "Completed" tab in your Home Page should now look similar to this:

More importantly, completing these tasks means that your profile in RadGrad is accurate: you will now be listed as a potential resource when students look at Interests and Career Goals.

Hopefully you have maximized your Visibility, which enables students to learn more about you.

If you want to get more involved with RadGrad, here are some ideas:

**Add Courses and Opportunities to your profile.** If you want, you can add use the Course and Opportunity Explorers to add courses and opportunities to your profile.  This lets students know that you are a resource regarding those courses and opportunities when they go to the corresponding details page.  Be sure to make them visible using the Visibility page, otherwise students won't see you.

**Learn how to manage verification requests and reviews.** RadGrad implements a moderation process to help verify that students have participated in Opportunities, and that any reviews they submit are appropriate for display in the system. If you would like to help out with that (and potentially get rid of those pesky High Priority checklist items), see a RadGrad administrator.

**Create Opportunities for your research projects.**  One of the most significant ways to support RadGrad is to design research opportunities that are appropriate for undergraduates, and advertise them to students within the system. This can be an effective way to get promising undergraduates to participate in your research project.

**Talk about RadGrad with your students.** If you believe that RadGrad can improve the undergraduate degree experience, please let your students know.  We know from prior comments from students that they are  influenced by faculty opinions about RadGrad.
