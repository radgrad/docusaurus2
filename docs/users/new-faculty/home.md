After logging in you will be taken to your Home Page, which should look similar to this:

### It's a To Do list

In RadGrad, the Faculty Home Page is a (somewhat) smart "To Do" list.  Each time you visit your Home Page, RadGrad analyzes the state of the system and your profile to figure out whether there are useful activities for you to do to support your students.

The Home Page is divided into three sections:

  1. **High Priority** tasks that should be taken care of quickly, though some of them need not be taken care of by new users like you.
  2. **Medium Priority** tasks are "good to do". We'll do some of those in this tutorial.
  3. **Completed** tasks are things that are OK for now.

In the above screen shot, there are three high priority tasks: Manage Verification Requests, Manage Reviews, and Terms and Conditions.

Clicking on the Medium Priority tab reveals four additional tasks for this faculty member:

As a new Faculty user of RadGrad, it's OK to leave two of the High Priority tasks (i.e. Manage Verification Requests and Manage Reviews) to others for now.

:::info Tip
You may have a different combination of High and Medium priority tasks when you login.  That's OK.

Let's take care of the Terms and Conditions next.
