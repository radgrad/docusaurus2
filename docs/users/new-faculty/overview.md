If you're on this page, we assume that you are a faculty member in a department that is introducing RadGrad, and want to know more about how you can help make RadGrad most useful to your students.

This section provides a tutorial to the faculty role in RadGrad for faculty who have not used the system before, or who want a refresher.

There are two basic goals for this tutorial:

  1. For you to become familiar with RadGrad so that you can answer student questions about it (and hopefully refer them to it when appropriate)

  2. To set up your RadGrad profile so that students will know that you are an appropriate resource person when their interests match yours.

To start, please click the "Next" link below to go to the first task in this tutorial.
