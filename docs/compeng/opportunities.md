VIP Projects | New | The University of Hawai`i (UH) is part of the Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Consortium, which consists of more than 30 institutions worldwide, led by the Georgia Institute of Technology. VIP programs at each institution seek to foster long-term, in-depth, project-based learning to engage students and better prepare them for future careers. VIP teams are vertically integrated: they consist of a faculty mentor, graduate student researchers, and undergraduates of all levels. The teams are large (10 to 20 undergraduates each semester), the projects are long-term (at least 5 years in scope), and are based on an externally funded research topic. Undergraduates in VIP teams earn academic credit for their participation.
