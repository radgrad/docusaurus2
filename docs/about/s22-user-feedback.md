## Summary of Observations


## Student Comments

### (1) 

Background
I joined the ICS department in my first semester of college. I decided to change my major from Computer Engineering to Computer Science (ICS). I choose to make this switch because I believe that there are more Computer Science jobs in Hawaii verses Computer Engineer jobs. Looking back, I believe changing my major was one of the best decisions I could have made. I now know that I have much more creative freedom of the classes I get to take, and I also have a passion for the software of technology verses the hardware.

Useful Advice for Noobies
Entering the ICS department, I was quite lost as I did not start in ICS compared to many of my peers. If I was to give advice to people entering ICS, I recommend getting to know the TA well, joining extra-curriculars, and the focus of this essay, participating in RadGrad. These 3 topics are the keys to success in the UH Manoa ICS department. I recommend getting to know your TA well because they will play a critical role in your ICS journey. The TA’s have been in your shoes a few years ago and knows how it feels. Joining extra-curriculars is beneficial because they allow you to add entries into your resume and make new friends. It is a good idea to look at ACM Manoa and attempt to get a computer science part-time job, it will be valuable experience.

RadGrad Summary
RadGrad is a useful tool that encourages engagement in the ICS program. With this engagement, RadGrad can help retain students in the ICS department. There are many important parts of RadGrad that will help make ICS students more desirable in the industry after graduation. In the explore tool, individuals will be able to find information on classes, extra-curriculars, and careers. I feel that this is one of RadGrad’s greatest features as it allows students to keep informed about the opportunities that are available, especially locally in Hawaii. Using the Planner tool, one can take the opportunities and place them in a Planner to help keep students plan and track their progress through the program. The ICE tab is an interesting metric that RadGrad tracks, it stands for Innovation, Competency, and Experience. This ICE metric is important because in order to be a successful individual in the industry, one must be well rounded in education, their innovations, and most importantly, their experiences. By the end of the academic journey, one will have a substantial advantage if all categories are filled up. The whole purpose of RadGrad was to help students in ICS become successful post-graduation.

RadGrad New User Tutorial
After completing the New User tutorial, I learned about many of the interest groups in the computer science industry. Previously, I thought that Computer science was just about writing code. Now that I saw RadGrad, I see that there are hundreds of interest categories available to focus on. The ones that caught my eye were algorithms, angular, application development, artificial intelligence, web development, human computer interaction, machine learning, and teaching. After reading each of the categories talked about above, I believe that these are my interests and what I would like to focus on in the future.

Sign Me Up!
If you could not already tell, I am a firm believer that RadGrad is an excellent tool to get UH Manoa ICS students involved in much more besides school. I recommend all ICS students participate and take advantage of Professor Johnson’s work. The link to RadGrad is https://radgrad2.ics.hawaii.edu/, most first-time users will need to get their accounts synced with the RadGrad system. To get added, please contact Professor Philip Johnson at johnson@hawaii.edu.

The Tool
At first I thought RadGrad was similar to STAR GPS, where it will keep track and organize your computer science class schedule. I was wrong, and instead has shown what I can do to improve my undergraduate degree experience. I learned that it may help improve degree planning and provide useful guidance to students in finding an appropiate undergraduate degree experience based on their specific interests and career goals.


The Stones
The most unique thing about radgrad is the ICE point system. It stands for Innovation, Competency, and Experience. It keeps track of the amount of points acquired from completed courses and opportunities. This is a useful system that helps students know what should be focused as they progress forward. My ICE point standing is at an okay level, and I should participate and take opportunities in order to improve to my innovation and experience points. Not just because I want to increase my points, it will help me prepare and perform well in future jobs.

The Path
The path I have been walking along is hazy and I do not know where it will lead to. With RadGrad it helps clear up the haze, making the next destination a little bit more clearer. Having no innovation or experiences, RadGrad introduced to me many opportunities, interests, and courses to open a path. Once I have found interests, possible careers, and opportunities I was able to place the possible stones I would need to reach the first destination.

Before RadGrad
Most students beginning their journey towards a college degree are unsure of the road ahead of them. In the constantly-expanding field of Computer Science, there are so many possibilities for you. However, as great as the many options are, they can become quite overwhelming. Seemingly endless questions can arise during your degree (what classes do I take, what do I want to do once I graduate, etc.). Luckily UH ICS students have access to a RadGrad that can answer your questions all in one spot.

First Impression
I got a chance in my first semester to experience RadGrad. In my initial impression of RadGrad, I was unsure of its purpose and confused all around. Throughout this module, I was able to grasp the intent of RadGrad. Returning, years later, I see there is a noticeable improvement upon RadGrad.

Do the Tutorial!
Finishing the RadGrad New User tutorial allowed me to see what the program offers, rather than logging in and being overwhelmed. There is a lot to do within RadGrad, and I have found it a helpful tool. Here, you have access to numerous ICS-related interests, careers, courses, and opportunities. Choosing specific ICS topics allows you to see the different courses offered at UH relating to your desired interest. You will find yourself getting lost (in a good way) on the site, adding more and more to your profile, and planning for the future.

RadGreat!
RadGrad will allow you to have a better degree experience and open your eyes to all possibilities. As a student who was once unsure where to begin within ICS, it helps filter and hone in where you want to specialize in ICS. Usually, students would be searching various media for all these ICS answers and opportunities, but thanks to RadGrad, they are all localized together. Which in turn makes the student experience much easier and more enjoyable. RadGrad helps direct, plan, and prepare you for the future, all while alleviating the stress of all the ICS questions you have and where you want to go once you graduate.

A Rad Tool
As a Computer Science student I felt that the Rad Grad tutorial was very insightful and introduced me to a bunch of new topics in the computer science realm. Growing up I wouldn’t say I was a complete tech whiz or was fascinated by building computers, but I do admire some of what technology has done and is doing for our lives. Moving forward with my education in this exciting and trail-blazing field, I found that Rad Grad can actually help improve my experience as an undergraduate and prepare me for after graduating.

Takeaways from the Tutorial
One way it can help me improve my undergraduate experience is to point me to new opportunities to build up my skills and show me others in my community that share common interests. Going through the Rad Grad tutorial I’m way better off now that I am aware of all these different events and side projects I can do like the Meteor Hackathon, HACC, and tackling “Cracking the Coding Interview”. Another great thing about going through the tutorial was it prompted me to pick some of my interests, where it exposed me to a broad spectrum of computer science topics and where I can learn more about them. Some piqued my interests more than others, and within the Rad Grad website you can see who else shares your interests and you can possibly make connections with bright like-minded individuals.

Planning for the Future
One of the best things Rad Grad has for me that ties everything together including the opportunities and future courses to take, is the planner feature. I am in my second semester as a sophomore and I feel like the planner with Rad Grad will help me form a better plan for the course of time in school and encourage me to do more extracurricular coding outside of classes. All in all I really like the foundation and core values of Rad Grad and all the new ideas and possibilities it has opened my eyes to. Looking forward to taking action on my planner and joining ACM along with participating in future events!

### (5)

After completing the RadGrad new user tutorial, my first impressions were very positive. It had introduced lots of new programs as well as neatly identified which courses cover certain topics like Databases or AI. However nearing the end I thought to myself, why should I keep track of and keep updating this RadGrad profile? There was no other monetary value other than maybe earning a sticker, it was just a helpful tool to further one’s education.

RadGrad as a College Resource
Personally, I think RadGrad is an excellent tool for students as it provides almost all the resources you will ever need to navigate through UH’s system. It provides clubs, internships, as well as a comment section for certain classes so students can know what they are getting into. However, I see no point in having to keep on updating on what you have finished as well as completing the whole RadGrad program as the path to graduation is already listed in STAR GPS. To me, RadGrad does very well as an online resource for students to keep track of opportunities as well as their progress but offers no incentive to keep on updating your progress.

Incentives
Throughout most of my years of schooling, I have found that people only really take classes if they have to or it offers something in return. RadGrad does not offer almost anything important to keep updating it over and over again to keep track of your progress. While I can see which classes are offered in the ICS Department, by updating does it show me how close I am to graduating with a degree in Data Science? If I update it for opportunities will it prove to me that I am now an experienced programmer or ready to take on the real world? No, it doesn’t so updating your profile offers almost nothing for someone’s personal gain and just serves as a checklist to all the things a person has completed in the ICS department.

Making RadGrad Better for the Individual
Despite my criticisms, I believe the RadGrad updating system can work as a very good community builder. Experienced students in the ICS department can give their input on classes as well as help guide students and the people new to RadGrad would believe them as their progress shows it. This however all relies on the effort of the individual to build a better community which doesn’t seem to work so far as from what I have seen as beyond level two there were only a handful of people updating their progress. Even then the Discord for ACM has already done a much better job of building a community as people can ask seniors about classes they have taken as well as get new opportunities. As it stands right now RadGrad is just another online resource for students to use. So then my suggestion is this then, incentivize people to update their progress. Give them something to work for such as a job, student benefits something that students would want to strive for. This will motivate them to update their progress, all helping to build a larger community.

Piece by Piece


Structure is key for success. If there’s any idea that has been solidified in my mind after this week, it would be that structure is a pivotal part of reaching any goal. No one has ever stumbled upon success or mastery of a skill. It is easiest to follow a structured program where you improve and learn regularly. After a week of being exposed to the RadGrad program, I can vouch for structure and order when it comes to achieving my goal to be a software engineer. It is common knowledge that becoming a professional in any given field requires practice and dedication. What is sometimes overlooked by many is that a structured program could be an extremely useful aspect of one’s practice. Take a monumental task like running a marathon. One doesn’t just decide to complete a marathon on a whim. To an untrained athlete, it would be almost impossible to one day decide to run over twenty miles in a given amount of hours. Obviously there is a lot of training involved prior to being able to complete a marathon. But what kind of training? Well, I’m no long distance runner but I would take a structured approach to hold yourself accountable. Start off with a small and easy task like running around the block once or twice. Each week, increment the difficulty and distance of the running. Make sure to challenge yourself at every step of the way and by the end of this training program you will come out a different person.

Look to the Future


Similarly to marathon running, software development is not an easy mission. After going through the RadGrad New user tutorial I have discovered a structure that I can follow to convert the monumental task of becoming a software developer, into smaller bite size missions and experiences. I discovered new opportunities for classes and extracurricular activities that I had not known before. Classes like programming artificial intelligence and machine learning were things that sparked my interest and I had not known that my university offered these courses. Extracurricular activities like the AT&T hackathon and the cybersecurity event are also interesting activities outside of school that I could get involved in to further my career. In the RadGrad program, I was able to rearrange my schedule for each semester of university and plan ahead as to what courses, extracurriculars, and internships I would plan on taking. This was extremely useful. Having every activity or course that interested me laid out by semester was awesome. I was free to manipulate each activity as I pleased and this gave me the opportunity to spread out my tasks evenly across the next two years of college. RadGrad was able to break down the process of finding interests, courses, and extracurriculars and make it easily digestible and manageable.

A Familiar Setting
As new of an experience RadGrad is for me, many of the features seen in this great platform have already been implemented into my life as a CS student here at UH Manoa. The degree planner is one of the things that I have been using prior to RadGrad which is an excellent way of keeping me on track to finishing my degree and getting the career I strive for. There are also tons of career options to browse through here, and it does seem overwhelming at times to pick and choose what I may want to do in the future, but that is what college is all about. Experimenting and trying new things to figure out what I want in life. I have seen many of the presented opportunities, careers, and interests, however, I still do not know what I may want to pursue on this current track.

Nothing is Set in Stone
Although I am a highly goal-oriented person, that does not mean that I have a clear-cut route to achieving my goals. As of now, my short/mid-term goal is to finish this degree with the ultimate goal of landing a great and stable job in the field of software engineering after college. RadGrad has shown me how diverse the career pool is for a CS major, and that is troubling for me because I am indecisive and do not know which to pick. I think this may be because I am still a second year in the program without much experience or courses under my belt just yet. One of the many things I hope to gain from RadGrad and college is the experience needed to determine what I want with this degree.

RadGrad Worth It?
I believe that RadGrad is a great platform to buckle down on what you have to do to achieve your goals no matter what it may be pertaining to the ICS curriculum. Although I cannot speak for everyone on this, I do think that RadGrad’s ability to improve our degree experience is beneficial, but also subjective. From personal experience in this degree as of now, I do not think RadGrad will be that beneficial for me in terms of further academic and career development because I already have a small idea of what I want. Though it is not fully clear what that may be, I was already exposed to most of the opportunities and careers present in RadGrad, so that is just my opinion of my own journey as of far.

In my opinion, someone in this degree path without any knowledge of what careers or opportunities are present will immensely benefit from using RadGrad.

Ninja
With all that said, even though I do not personally think RadGrad will be as beneficial for me, it does not hurt to consistently use the platform for personal use. I do hope to ultimately reach the ninja level black badge as a little trophy to myself that I was able to reach this moment. If I am able to reach ninja-level status, then I know for sure that I will be ready for whatever comes my path.

Up to this point in my life, my approach to education was to put just enough effort into my studies to earn mostly A’s. I started this school year taking all of my courses online, and I kept up with this approach, barely hitting deadlines, cramming for tests, and focusing more on pursuing my hobbies than on my education and future career. One reason I am grateful to have started in-person courses again is that my education experience has since become much more involved. Partially due to this involvement, I’ve recently realized that I’m not doing as much for my major as I would like to. Computer science and programming are things which I genuinely enjoy. Programming had been a hobby of mine in the past, but recently I’ve been treating it as an obligation I fulfill in order to earn a grade. If I pick it up again as a hobby, the progress I could make would be many times greater than if I limit myself to only completing my assignments.

What is RadGrad?
RadGrad is a resource offered at the University of Hawaii for undergraduate students in STEM which is meant to improve their degree experience. It has a tool called “Planner” which makes it easy to see all of the relevant courses available and to create a degree plan. While creating a degree plan was already possible through another UH resource called “Star”, the RadGrad planner makes it much easier to discover all of the potential course one could take in order to complete their degree. On top of this, Planner makes available all of the computer science related extracurricular activities I was previously unaware of such as hackathons, extra lessons, and other legitimately useful projects which are open to students for collaboration. Another cool feature of RadGrad is that it allows you to select your specific interests within the field of computer science and add them to your profile. This not only allows you to connect with people who have similar interests, it also exposes you to areas of computer science you’ve probably never heard of or thought about! If I had been asked to list off as many fields of computer science I could think of, I probably would have been able to list 10 to 15. RadGrad has 78, including things I’ve certainly never heard of such as bioinformatics and theory of computation.

Introduction
I think RadGrad is totally rad. Corny jokes aside I genuinely do think that RadGrad is an invaluable program that should be introduced to all computer science students. Although it does seem a little overwhelming at first that should not be a deterrent from experiencing RadGrad. I thought I knew a good amount as to what is out there for computer science. I learned that there is something called Social Computing, this is an area where they study the interactions of social behavior and computational systems. I did not even know that was a thing until I went on RadGrad.

Full Stack Developer
While going through RadGrad I figured I should check out some Java Script/Html type of things since I am taking a class in that area. Following that line of interest, I happen to stumble upon something called a full stack developer. A full stack developer is someone who is able to handle both the front and back end of a website. I have not learned too much of how the back end of a website works but, since taking ICS314 it has piqued my interest in learning about how to develop web applications as a whole.

Linux
While being involved in the back-end development of web applications I happened to come across Linux in RadGrad. I have always heard about Linux but never really investigated it until now. On the opportunity page, I found a section about Linux and how you can learn about it in five days which is not much time at all. Yes, I could have found this if I searched google. What RadGrad offers that google does not is a tailored experience for computer science majors.

How to Start on my Path?
Many people choose to go to college to get their degrees and get qualifications required for a high-paying job. However, as we all know, just because you have a college degree, it does not guarantee a well-paid job. Many job markets are very competitive and getting your degree itself is very expensive and time consuming. Some students have to support themselves, without any support from friends or family and this can make it hard for them to achieve their dreams and start on their career. They can end up lost and lose their starting point on their path. Thankfully, RadGrad attempts to guide these students and provide them with opportunities, goals and courses that can help them start on their path in career development.

For me personally, RadGrad is a new experience and tool, but I have already implemented many of the features on the platform in my school life. I have been planning my degree from day one and I looked for opportunities such as competitions and internships. However, RadGrad introduced me to many opportunities, interests, and courses that I didn’t know existed. Using what is provided, I was able to improve the plan I had and figured out new things I wanted to try and experiment with.



Experience RadGrad
Although I like to be organized and set goals, sometimes it can get overwhelming and I lose track of what I wanted to do. Eventually, it led me to lose motivation and focus because I had no idea what I wanted to do after I got my degree. RadGrad showed me that there is more to the computer science world than I originally thought. There are a lot of goals and opportunities out there that I did not know much about. RadGrad can show us a list of opportunities, courses, and careers based on what we are interested in. It helped me to narrow down what I might want to do in the future. The platform also gives us feedback on how much our choices will help us in different aspects and if it will lead us to completion.

I appreciated the descriptions and video explanations of what is required of these different jobs because it helped me to understand what I would do to some degree. The vast pool of options helped me to think more about what field of computer science I want to go into and where I should set my standards. I know for sure I would like to go into software development or artificial intelligence.

Worth It?
I believe RadGrad can be worth it to some individuals. Those who do not know what they want to do, those who do not have any guidance, etc. RadGrad is a great platform for those individuals to start on their path and plan out their degree and future. It is a platform that can help us see the vast pool of opportunities and careers waiting for us. For me personally, although RadGrad showed me more opportunities that I did not know about, it did not really benefit me in terms of improving my academic development since I already had my courses planned out and some internships and competitions that I wanted to join. However, I may continue to use the platform just to keep track of what I still have left to do to complete my degree.

RadGrad is beneficial in planning out and helping with maximizing your degree experience. I believe the point tracker is helpful since it helps visualize what different opportunities will guide you to like innovation, competency, and experience. This allows students to choose opportunities, courses, and goals that will help their degree experience. One aspect that would be nice to add to this platform is connections or resources that connect you to companies that pertain to your interests and goals.
