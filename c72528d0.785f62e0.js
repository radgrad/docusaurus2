For example, in the introduction video it was mentioned that someone was working on an app that can inform you of your rights in any location. In a world where the law can be unjust, especially towards minority groups, it can be so valuable to have some kind of information on what your rights are as a person in the United States in an emergency, especially because many of us are unaware of these rights as we have not studied law.

Looking through the RadGrad opportunities made me realize that whenever I have an idea (for example, an idea for an app), I should make note of it and continue to build on it because there will most likely be a group of people who would be interested in working on something similar.
